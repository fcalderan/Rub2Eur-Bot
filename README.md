# RUB2EUR Bot

A Python-based bot that scrapes exchange rate data from Google Finance and periodically posts the RUB/EUR exchange rate to specified platforms, such as X/Twitter or BlueSky.

## Project Overview

This project automates the retrieval and publication of exchange rate data for the Russian Ruble (RUB) and Euro (EUR). It uses:

- **Playwright**: For web scraping exchange rate data and generating visual snapshots.
- **Tweepy**: For interacting with X/Twitter's API to post updates.
- **BlueSky Client**: For posting updates to the decentralized BlueSky platform.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Organized into reusable components for scraping and platform-specific interactions.

### Key Features

- Fetches real-time exchange rates and trends.
- Takes screenshots of exchange rate charts without saving to disk (uses in-memory processing).
- Posts updates to XTwitter and BlueSky, ensuring accessibility with alt-text descriptions.
- Configurable schedule for periodic updates.

## Project Structure

- `utils/`: Contains reusable components for scraping and posting.
  - `exchangeRateScraper.py`: Handles web scraping logic.
  - `exchangeRateBot.py`: Encapsulates platform-specific logic.
- `.env`: Stores sensitive API credentials securely.
- `rub2eur-X.py`: The main entry point for the X/Twitter bot.
- `rub2eur-bsky.py`: The main entry point for the BlueSky bot.

### Why This Organization?

The modular design makes it easy to:

- Reuse or change scraping logic (exchangeRateScraper.py) .
- Reuse or change post composition and automation (exchangeRateBot.py).
- Securely manage credentials through the .env file.


## How to Set Up and Run Locally

### Prerequisites

1. Install Python 3.8 or higher.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install playwright tweepy python-dotenv
   playwright install


### Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

    # X/Twitter API credentials
    X_API_KEY=your_api_key
    X_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
    X_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
    X_ACCESS_SECRET=your_access_secret
    X_BEARER_TOKEN=your_bearer_token
    
    # BlueSky API credentials
    BSKY_USERNAME=your_bsky_username
    BSKY_PASSWORD=your_bsky_password
    
Replace placeholder values with your actual credentials.

For X/Twitter, learn how to obtain these credentials from the [X/Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.x.com/en).

### Running the Bot

For X/Twitter:

    python rub2eur-X.py

For BlueSky:

    python rub2eur-bsky.py

The bot will immediately fetch exchange rates, post updates, and schedule further executions.


**Example Output**
A sample Xeet/Tweet or BlueSky post:

> üá∑üá∫üá™üá∫ RUB/EUR: 0.00896  
Live #RUBEUR rate as of 01/01/2024 12:00 Berlin's time. Chart of the trend for the last 5 days.
